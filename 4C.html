 <h1>I got a message from Sander on 06/11 saying the link to this assignment did not work. Unfortunately, I cannot find the footage of this exercise. I used up all my wires for soldering my final project so I am unable to recreate the assignment and put the footage here. The best I can do is disclose the code I used.</h1>
